This   project  focuses on predicting diabetes using advanced machine learning techniques. It involves full data preprocessing, feature engineering, balancing classes with SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning with XGBoost, and ensemble modeling to achieve an improved accuracy of around 83%. Key evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and precision-recall curves, are visualized for better interpretation. This streamlined pipeline offers a highly accurate and interpretable solution for early diabetes detection.
